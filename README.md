📝 DOM Manipulation | Form Handling | Image Upload Project

## 👩‍💻 What I Built

This is a real-time project that allows users to fill out a form with the following details:
- ✅ Name
- ✅ Email
- ✅ Message
- ✅ Upload Image

Upon submitting the form:
- 📌 A beautifully styled card is dynamically created displaying the user's info and uploaded image.
- 📌 All user cards are displayed vertically in a clean, column layout.
- 📌 The form resets itself automatically after submission.

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- 👍 Selecting DOM elements using `document.querySelector()`
- 👍 Listening to form events with `addEventListener()`
- 👍 Creating and appending elements with `createElement()`
- 👍 Reading uploaded files using `FileReader()`
- 👍 Styling layout using **Flexbox**
- 👍 Clearing the form using `form.reset()`
